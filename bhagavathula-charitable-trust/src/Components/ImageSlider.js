      8th June 2022 - Uncategorised
      BCT initiated a 10-day teachers training program for government school teachers in tribal Paderu.

This technique-based program enables teachers to train students from English Illiteracy to a stage where they can read, write, comprehend & structure grammatically correct sentences.

2. Inclusive Education: To increase participation of children with disabilities in mainstream schools, this enables all stakeholders involved in the education of children with disabilities with appropriate awareness, knowledge, and skills. It promotes inclusion for such children in home-based programs at schools and raises awareness among teachers, parents, and the community.

3. Prerana Motivation (students): Sikshana‚Äôs Prerana program is designed as a scalable and replicable model with a child-centric approach, making primary education an enjoyable process & motivating children towards improved & holistic learning .

4. My Shaala App: Provided to mentors, it helps them to capture and mentor all relevant data on their mobiles.

5. We Love Reading: This program focuses on inculcating the reading habit among students. It aims at creating readers, developing foundational literacy skills, conceptual and skill-based knowledge development. Book banks in schools, weekly reading hour periods, creating classroom reading corners, forming community reading rooms, conducting reading melas & fests, are some key activities.

The end of February brought in with it the feel of normalcy, as students could yet again go for the much awaited school picnic. While the school conducts a picnic for its students every year, the past 2 years did not have any picnics due to Covid. However this year, all school students were taken by buses to the Visakhapatnam zoo and Tenneti park for a school picnic. Needless to say, the children enjoyed this lovely outing with friends. The unexpected cherry on the top was the Navy day parade which was happening at the same day. The thrilled children enjoyed seeing the many ships and aerial displays on the occasion.`
